In this blogpost I'll try to backtrack on the previous code night on "Introduction to hardware programming" and go through the examples and principles that we touched on and explain them in a lecture-oriented manner.
I'll also go abit further than the code night and give examples in python and on subjects that were not included in the code night. 

As with most things, we will start with the basics, electricity and circuits!
